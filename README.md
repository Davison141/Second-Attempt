## What I learned

I learnt how to center elements without adding huge margins to wherever side i want to adjust as i did on my last solution, a comment gave me tips on how to write it better. If you went through my last project, you'll notice i used the wrong element for the list, used px on the margin, padding and font size and i also used id's recklessly. I'd like to get a feedback on how i did on this solution.  

## Continued development

I'll definitely be focusing in on how to center and position elements better.
